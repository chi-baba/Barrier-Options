# Barrier-Options
Barrier options are a type of path-dependent exotic option in which the payoff depends on the price of the underlying asset crossing a predefined barrier level.

There are four main types of barrier options:

**Up-and-Out:** The barrier level lies above the spot price and the option is knocked out when the underlying rises above the barrier level.

**Down-and-Out:** The barrier level lies below the spot price and the option is knocked out when the underlying drops below the barrier level.

**Up-and-In:** The barrier level lies above the spot price and the option is activated when the underlying rises above the barrier level.

**Down-and-In:** The barrier level lies below the spot price and the option is activated when the underlying drops below the barrier level.

Here, the four types of Barrier options are priced for both calls and puts using the analytic expressions.
